# CLI reference

This document defines the implemented Nagi commands and their JSON interface. `--json` may appear anywhere in the argument list. Without it, Nagi prints text intended for terminal reading. Scripts and applications should use `--json` rather than parse the text presentation.

## Help and syntax

Run `nagi`, `nagi help`, `nagi -h`, or `nagi --help` for top-level help. Use `nagi help profile use` or `nagi profile use --help` for a command's syntax, description, and example. `-h` is also accepted for command help. Help topics contain command names, without positional argument values.

Valid help requests exit with status `0`, even if runtime configuration is invalid or mihomo is unavailable. With `--json`, help text is a string in the success envelope's `data` field. Unknown help topics and incorrect argument counts exit with status `2` and show the relevant usage or help syntax. Argument counts and the `logs` integer range are checked before runtime configuration is read.

## Commands

| Command | Result or effect |
| --- | --- |
| `start`, `stop`, `restart` | Manage the mihomo process. `start` creates the default profile if absent. |
| `status` | Report running state, selected profile, PID, paths, and available mihomo version and mixed port. |
| `logs [lines]` | Return the last 100 lines by default, or 1 through 10000 lines. |
| `config validate` | Check the selected profile with `mihomo -t`. |
| `config show` | Return the selected profile YAML. |
| `profile list` | List profile names and the current selection. |
| `profile use NAME` | Validate and activate an existing profile, reloading a running mihomo instance. |
| `profile import NAME FILE` | Validate and atomically write a profile from a local YAML file (maximum 8 MiB). |
| `subscription list` | List names and refresh times without URLs. |
| `subscription add NAME URL` | Save an HTTP or HTTPS subscription URL. |
| `subscription update NAME` | Fetch up to 8 MiB into Nagi's cache. |
| `subscription apply NAME` | Validate cached YAML as a mihomo profile, import it as profile `NAME`, and activate it. |
| `subscription remove NAME` | Remove a saved subscription and its cache. |
| `proxy groups`, `proxy show GROUP` | Read mihomo proxy groups through its Unix Socket API. |
| `proxy select GROUP NODE` | Select a node in a group. |
| `connections list` | Return a snapshot of active connections. |
| `service install`, `service uninstall` | Manage a per-user launchd Agent or systemd service. |
| `version` | Report Nagi version, mihomo version and pinned commit, OS, and architecture. |

Profile and subscription names consist of ASCII letters, digits, `_`, or `-` and have a maximum length of 128 characters. A profile file is named `profiles/NAME.yaml`. `subscription update` accepts HTTP 200 responses only. Nagi saves the response in its own cache. For subscriptions that contain a complete mihomo YAML configuration, `subscription apply` validates and activates it. Other subscription formats require conversion outside Nagi before importing a profile.

## Text output

Status output labels the running state, selected profile, and available process details. Profile lists mark the current selection; proxy output identifies the current node. Empty lists have an explanatory message. `logs` prints individual log lines, and `config show` prints YAML directly.

Subscription feedback distinguishes saving a URL from downloading content and applying a profile. Downloading does not change the selected profile. Applying selects the profile and reloads a running engine; it does not start a stopped engine. Profile import validates and writes a file; use `profile use NAME` to select it. Replacing the currently selected profile also reloads a running engine; importing another profile does not reload it. Valid replacement content can repair an invalid existing profile.

## Recovery and service failures

An invalid selected-profile record does not prevent `stop`, `logs`, `version`, service management, subscription listing/downloading/removal, or proxy and connection operations. `status` still reports process state, omitting `profile` and adding `profile_error` when the selection cannot be read. `profile list` still lists files, omitting `current` and adding `current_error`. Text output warns that the selection is unavailable. Use `profile use NAME` with an existing valid profile or `subscription apply NAME` with valid cached content to repair an invalid selection. Import and removal require a readable selection so Nagi can determine whether their target is active.

If saving a subscription refresh time fails, Nagi attempts to restore the previous cache, or remove a newly created cache. Restoration failures are also returned. A failed refresh does not activate a profile.

If service installation fails after writing its definition, Nagi attempts to restore the old definition or remove the new one. The error reports the file outcome; service manager state can still have changed and must be checked before retrying. Uninstallation retains the definition if stopping/disabling the service fails. If the final systemd reload fails after removing the definition, the error explains that removal already completed and asks for a reload. An absent definition makes uninstallation a no-op; this does not verify that the service manager has no loaded service.

## Configuration validation failures

Nagi omits mihomo validation stdout and stderr because they may contain configuration values. Errors provide a next step instead: inspect the selected configuration for `config validate` or startup failures, and inspect the source YAML being imported/applied or the profile being selected for profile operations. Missing executable errors suggest checking `NAGI_MIHOMO_BIN`.

To inspect mihomo's own diagnostics locally, use `mihomo -t -f FILE -d DIRECTORY`, replacing `FILE` with the configuration file and `DIRECTORY` with its configuration directory. Use the executable selected by `NAGI_MIHOMO_BIN` when applicable. Those diagnostics may contain private configuration values. Nagi does not expose its temporary validation files as a recovery path.

## JSON and exit codes

JSON success output has the shape `{"ok":true,"data":{...}}`. JSON failure output is written to stderr as `{"ok":false,"error":{"code":"...","message":"..."}}`. Successful commands exit with status `0`; usage errors exit with `2`; all other errors exit with `1`. Error codes include `usage`, `already_running`, `not_running`, `not_found`, `invalid_config`, `profile_error`, `subscription_error`, `proxy_selection_error`, `mihomo_api_error`, and `internal_error`. These codes and field names are the CLI integration contract for the macOS app.

`NAGI_MIHOMO_BIN` overrides the default mihomo executable path, which is a file named `mihomo` beside the Nagi executable. Nagi uses XDG directories on Linux and `~/Library/Application Support/Nagi` on macOS; see the [runtime design](../design/runtime.md).
