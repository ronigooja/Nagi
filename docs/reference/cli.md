# CLI reference

This document defines the implemented Nagi commands and their JSON interface. `--json` may appear anywhere in the argument list. Without it, Nagi prints text intended for terminal reading. Scripts and applications should use `--json` rather than parse the text presentation.

## Help and syntax

Run `nagi`, `nagi help`, `nagi -h`, or `nagi --help` for top-level help. Use `nagi help profile use` or `nagi profile use --help` for a command's syntax, description, and example. `-h` is also accepted for command help. Help topics contain command names, without positional argument values.

Valid help requests exit with status `0`, even if runtime configuration is invalid or mihomo is unavailable. With `--json`, help text is a string in the success envelope's `data` field. Unknown help topics and incorrect argument counts exit with status `2` and show the relevant usage or help syntax. Argument counts and the `logs` integer range are checked before runtime configuration is read.

## Commands

| Command | Result or effect |
| --- | --- |
| `start`, `stop`, `restart` | Manage the mihomo process. `start` creates the default profile if absent. |
| `status` | Report running state, selected profile, PID, paths, and available mihomo version and mixed port. |
| `doctor` | Produce a read-only diagnostic report with checks and suggested next steps. |
| `logs [lines]` | Return the last 100 lines by default, or 1 through 10000 lines. |
| `config validate` | Check the selected profile with `mihomo -t`. |
| `config show` | Return the selected profile YAML. |
| `profile list` | List profile names and the current selection. |
| `profile use NAME` | Validate and activate an existing profile, reloading a running mihomo instance. |
| `profile import NAME FILE` | Validate and atomically write a profile from a local YAML file (maximum 8 MiB). |
| `profile remove NAME` | Delete an unselected regular profile file, retaining any existing `.bak` file. |
| `subscription list` | List names and refresh times without URLs. |
| `subscription add NAME URL` | Save an HTTP or HTTPS subscription URL. |
| `subscription update NAME` | Fetch up to 8 MiB into Nagi's cache. |
| `subscription apply NAME` | Validate cached YAML as a mihomo profile, import it as profile `NAME`, and activate it. |
| `subscription remove NAME` | Remove a saved subscription and its cache. |
| `proxy groups`, `proxy show GROUP` | Read mihomo proxy groups through its Unix Socket API. |
| `proxy select GROUP NODE` | Select a node in a group. |
| `proxy delay NODE [URL] [TIMEOUT_MS]` | Measure a proxy's HTTP request latency through mihomo. |
| `connections list` | Return a snapshot of active connections. |
| `connections close ID` | Request closure of a connection by its ID. |
| `connections close-all` | Request closure of all current connections. |
| `mode [rule\|global\|direct]` | Read or change the running engine's routing mode. |
| `service install`, `service uninstall` | Manage a per-user launchd Agent or systemd service. |
| `version` | Report Nagi version, mihomo version and pinned commit, OS, and architecture. |
| `completion bash\|zsh\|fish` | Print a shell completion script without reading runtime configuration. |

Profile and subscription names consist of ASCII letters, digits, `_`, or `-` and have a maximum length of 128 characters. A profile file is named `profiles/NAME.yaml`. `subscription update` accepts HTTP 200 responses only. Nagi saves the response in its own cache. For subscriptions that contain a complete mihomo YAML configuration, `subscription apply` validates and activates it. Other subscription formats require conversion outside Nagi before importing a profile.

## Diagnostics

`doctor` inspects directory availability and owner read/search permission bits, the mihomo executable (including `NAGI_MIHOMO_BIN` resolved through `PATH`), selected-profile readability, PID liveness, and the Unix Socket `/version` endpoint. It does not create directories, change files, start the engine, validate YAML with mihomo, or test proxy connectivity. A live PID does not establish process identity. The API check has a two-second deadline.

The result is `{"healthy":true,"checks":[{"name":"...","status":"ok","message":"..."}]}` inside the success envelope. `status` is `ok`, `warning`, or `error`; `healthy` is false if any check has status `error`. Check names are `config_directory`, `data_directory`, `state_directory`, `runtime_directory`, `mihomo_executable`, `selected_profile`, `process`, and `control_api`. Missing first-use directories, a missing default profile, and a stopped engine can be warnings. A missing executable, invalid selection, missing selected non-default profile, or stale PID is an error.

A completed diagnostic report exits with status `0`, even when `healthy` is false. Scripts must inspect `data.healthy` and the individual checks. Failure to construct the report uses the normal error envelope and exit status `1`.

## Profile removal

`profile remove NAME` refuses to delete the selected profile, a nonregular file, or any profile when the current selection cannot be read. Select another profile first with `profile use NAME`. Missing profiles fail with `profile_error`. Removal does not delete a subscription with the same name or its cache. Existing `NAME.yaml.bak` files remain available for manual recovery; they are not listed as profiles.

## Proxy latency, connections, and mode

`proxy delay NODE [URL] [TIMEOUT_MS]` defaults to `https://www.gstatic.com/generate_204` and `5000` milliseconds. Supply a URL before a custom timeout. The URL must be absolute HTTP or HTTPS without user information; the timeout must be an integer from `1` through `30000`. Invalid arguments fail before contacting the engine. The CLI allows up to 31 seconds for the control request, so the maximum measurement timeout is not cut short by the ordinary ten-second API timeout. `NODE` is a mihomo proxy name, including built-ins such as `DIRECT`; names with spaces must be quoted. The pinned mihomo implementation sends an HTTP HEAD request and records the latency in the proxy's delay history. This measures request latency, not bandwidth.

```sh
nagi proxy delay 'Node A'
nagi proxy delay 'Node A' https://example.com/ 8000
nagi connections list
nagi connections close CONNECTION_ID
nagi mode global
nagi mode
```

Replace `Node A` and `CONNECTION_ID` with names and IDs from your engine. Connection lists show IDs in text and JSON. Closing an ID that has already disappeared succeeds because mihomo treats it as an idempotent request. `close-all` is explicit, noninteractive, and affects all connections present when mihomo processes the request. Applications may immediately establish new connections. No closed-connection count is returned.

`mode` without an argument reads the running mode. With `rule`, `global`, or `direct`, it changes only the running engine through `PATCH /configs`. It does not edit profile YAML; restarting or reloading a profile reapplies the mode in that configuration. All commands in this section require a reachable mihomo Unix Socket API.

## Shell completion

`completion bash`, `completion zsh`, and `completion fish` print scripts for the selected shell. Text mode prints the script directly; `--json` returns it as the envelope's string `data`. Generation does not require mihomo or a valid selected profile. Completions cover command names, subcommands, global flags, supported mode/shell values, and local files for profile import. Profile names, proxy names, and connection IDs are not queried dynamically.

Load the script in the corresponding shell:

```sh
# Bash
source <(nagi completion bash)

# Zsh (initialize completion first)
autoload -Uz compinit
compinit
source <(nagi completion zsh)

# Fish
nagi completion fish | source
```

## Text output

Status output labels the running state, selected profile, and available process details. Profile lists mark the current selection; proxy output identifies the current node. Empty lists have an explanatory message. `logs` prints individual log lines, and `config show` prints YAML directly.

Subscription feedback distinguishes saving a URL from downloading content and applying a profile. Downloading does not change the selected profile. Applying selects the profile and reloads a running engine; it does not start a stopped engine. Profile import validates and writes a file; use `profile use NAME` to select it. Replacing the currently selected profile also reloads a running engine; importing another profile does not reload it. Valid replacement content can repair an invalid existing profile.

## Recovery and service failures

An invalid selected-profile record does not prevent `stop`, `logs`, `version`, service management, subscription listing/downloading/removal, or proxy and connection operations. `status` still reports process state, omitting `profile` and adding `profile_error` when the selection cannot be read. `profile list` still lists files, omitting `current` and adding `current_error`. Text output warns that the selection is unavailable. Use `profile use NAME` with an existing valid profile or `subscription apply NAME` with valid cached content to repair an invalid selection. Import and removal require a readable selection so Nagi can determine whether their target is active.

If saving a subscription refresh time fails, Nagi attempts to restore the previous cache, or remove a newly created cache. Restoration failures are also returned. A failed refresh does not activate a profile.

If service installation fails after writing its definition, Nagi attempts to restore the old definition or remove the new one. The error reports the file outcome; service manager state can still have changed and must be checked before retrying. Uninstallation retains the definition if stopping/disabling the service fails. If the final systemd reload fails after removing the definition, the error explains that removal already completed and asks for a reload. An absent definition makes uninstallation a no-op; this does not verify that the service manager has no loaded service.

## Configuration validation failures

Nagi omits mihomo validation stdout and stderr because they may contain configuration values. Errors provide a next step instead: inspect the selected configuration for `config validate` or startup failures, and inspect the source YAML being imported/applied or the profile being selected for profile operations. Missing executable errors suggest checking `NAGI_MIHOMO_BIN`.

To inspect mihomo's own diagnostics locally, use `mihomo -t -f FILE -d DIRECTORY`, replacing `FILE` with the configuration file and `DIRECTORY` with its configuration directory. Use the executable selected by `NAGI_MIHOMO_BIN` when applicable. Those diagnostics may contain private configuration values. Nagi does not expose its temporary validation files as a recovery path.

## JSON and exit codes

JSON success output has the shape `{"ok":true,"data":{...}}`. JSON failure output is written to stderr as `{"ok":false,"error":{"code":"...","message":"..."}}`. Successful commands exit with status `0`; usage errors exit with `2`; all other errors exit with `1`. Error codes include `usage`, `already_running`, `not_running`, `not_found`, `invalid_config`, `profile_error`, `subscription_error`, `proxy_selection_error`, `mihomo_api_error`, and `internal_error`. These codes and field names are the CLI integration contract for the macOS app.

Additional success payloads are defined below; all appear in `data`:

| Command | Fields |
| --- | --- |
| `doctor` | `healthy` (boolean), `checks` (array of `name`, `status`, and `message` strings), as defined above. |
| `profile remove NAME` | `name` (string), `removed: true`, `kind: "profile"`. |
| `proxy delay` | `proxy` and `url` (strings), `timeout_ms` and `delay_ms` (integer milliseconds). |
| `connections close ID` | `id` (string), `closed: true` (request accepted, including an already absent connection). |
| `connections close-all` | `closed: true` (request accepted; no count). |
| `mode` | `mode` (string: `rule`, `global`, or `direct`). |
| `mode MODE` | `mode` (string), `changed: true` (update accepted). |
| `completion SHELL` | A string containing the completion script. |

`NAGI_MIHOMO_BIN` overrides the default mihomo executable path, which is a file named `mihomo` beside the Nagi executable. Nagi uses XDG directories on Linux and `~/Library/Application Support/Nagi` on macOS; see the [runtime design](../design/runtime.md).
